# Work Backwards

Work Backwards is a habit-building app based on the principle of backwards chaining - a learning technique commonly used in music education where complex pieces are learned by starting from the end and working backwards. This approach is applied to habit formation, making it easier for users to build up to longer durations of focused practice.

## Core Concept

The app works by:
1. Having users set an end time for their practice (e.g., 5:00 PM)
2. Starting with a short duration (e.g., 5 minutes) and gradually increasing it
3. Keeping the end time fixed while moving the start time earlier each day
4. Tracking success and adjusting difficulty accordingly

For example:
- Day 1: 4:55 PM - 5:00 PM (5 minutes)
- Day 2: 4:50 PM - 5:00 PM (10 minutes)
- Day 3: 4:45 PM - 5:00 PM (15 minutes)

## Use Cases

### Posture Training
- Perfect for office workers who need to maintain good posture
- Gradually builds up core strength and muscle memory
- End time can align with end of workday

### Meditation
- Build up meditation practice from short sessions
- Consistent end time helps establish daily routine
- Progress tracking motivates continued practice

### Focus Work
- Deep work sessions that gradually increase in length
- Fixed end time helps with scheduling
- Success tracking helps identify optimal duration

### Exercise
- Standing desk intervals
- Stretching routines
- Basic exercises (planks, wall sits)

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- React Native / Expo
- Expo Router for navigation
- Expo Notifications for reminders
- AsyncStorage for progress persistence

### Key Features
- Daily notifications
- Progress tracking
- Success/failure reporting
- Streak counting
- Adaptive difficulty

### Data Structure
```javascript
{
  practice: {
    endTime: Date,
    currentDuration: number,
    streak: number,
    history: [{
      date: Date,
      duration: number,
      success: boolean
    }]
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term
- Custom increment/decrement amounts
- Multiple practice types
- Daily stats and graphs
- Rest day scheduling

### Medium Term
- Social features (shared goals)
- Achievement system
- Custom notification sounds
- Calendar integration

### Long Term
- AI-powered difficulty adjustment
- Integration with health apps
- Wearable device support
- Video guidance for exercises

## Behavioral Science Elements

The app incorporates several proven behavioral science principles:
- Progressive overload
- Fixed anchoring (end time)
- Success-based progression
- Streak maintenance
- Clear feedback loops

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- Basic timer setup
